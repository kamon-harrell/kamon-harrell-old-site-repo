               <strong>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</strong>
               <p> When inspected individualy, all three of the prospects seems great, its only when we compare them against each other that we see the advantages and disadvantages of one over the other. When we are living life only for pleasure, we find ourself in a constant state of peaks and valleys. Pleasure, as is its nature, is short lived, and we must eventually return to baseline. This leaves us striving for the next temporary fix, trying to make our selves happy again. As im sure you've determined by now, this is unsustainable, and not the best way to find true fulfillment. When we switch our focus to passion, we are starting on the right path to sustainable happiness. Working with passion translates to flow, which is a state of being where you become completely absorbed in the current activity, and everything else fades into the background. This more often than not occurs when an individual is involved with an activity that they find plesuarable, and at just the right difficulty to keep them engaged. To easy of an activity, and the indivivual loses interest, to difficult, and the indivivual gets discouraged. Many people report while in flow that they experience elevated happiness, which, the more often someone is in the flow state, the more it transfers to their everyday lives. Finally, we get to the option that seems like the most sustainable method for achieving long term happiness, which is living life with a higher purpose. All of this makes sense to me in ways i hadent thought about before. When i think about living my life for a higher purpose, it makes complete sense that this is the best way to be happy, for when you are living with the intent of doing something beyond yourself, it brings a sense of calm that cannot be achieved when living for selfish means.</p>

             <strong>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,</strong>
                <ul>
                  <strong><li>What are your core values?</li></strong>
                    <p> My core values are integrity, tactfulness, kindness, creativity, growth and drive.   </p>
                  <strong><li> What do you stand for? </li></strong>
                  <p> I stand for personal freedoms. I stand for people helping each other to achieve their goals. I stand for living a peaceful life. I stand for being the creator of my life, and not taking a backseat. I stand for knowing your limits, and always pushing them forward.</p>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <strong> How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise? </strong>
              <p> The meditation exercise, as usual, was quite profound. Going back and touching on things that were upsetting, like a faliure is never easy, but by allowing myself to experience these things as an existential experience instead of internalizing them felt nice. Allowing them to come and go as they please is a very relieveing feeling. the same goes for when i switched to thoughts of a time of success. This part was a bit harder to do, as thinking of a pleasent experience, and allowing it to be just that, and let it pass, was difficult. When it comes to my thoughts on resilience, this ties into my life experiences quite well. I've failed at many things in my life, but i use those failures to power myself forward, and keep pushing towards my dreams and my goals. There will always be bumps in the road, but i like to envision myself as the car, and not the shock absorber. </p>
