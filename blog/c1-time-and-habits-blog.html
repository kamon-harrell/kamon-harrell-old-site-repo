     I initialy tried doing a timebox for 1 hour to read and skim the provided material. I got through reading and watching almost all of the material in this time, and I felt this was an effective way for me to dedicate part of my day to learning and reading about new material.<br>The part I found most interesting was how meditation affects the amount of brain waves that are created and processed, and how different practices of meditation create different reactions in the brain.<br>In the past i have found that meditation works wonders for me, and im excited to develop this practice more throughout my time at EDA, and my life.
