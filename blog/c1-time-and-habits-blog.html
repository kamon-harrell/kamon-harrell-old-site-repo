       <h2> My thoughts on time management, and habits. </h2>
         <p>
         I initialy tried doing a timebox for 1 hour to read and skim the provided material. I got through reading and watching almost all of the material in this time, and I felt this was an effective way for me to dedicate part of my day to learning and reading about new material.

          The part I found most interesting was how meditation affects the amount of brain waves that are created and processed, and how different practices  of meditation create different reactions in the brain.In the past i have found that meditation works wonders for me, and im excited to develop this practice more throughout my time at EDA, and my life.
