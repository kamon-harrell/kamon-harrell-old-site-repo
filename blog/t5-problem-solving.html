               <strong>What was a time i got blocked on a simple problem?</strong>
               <p>I was working on a lesson where we had to write out some code to make parts of our webpage
               respond to different actions. I had followed the instructions perfectly (or so I thought), and be all accounts, everything should work. I save the changes to my document, and reload my browser, arrogantly thinking the super cool changes I just made will work perfectly, except... there's no changes, infact, it all stopped working. I searched and searched through my code, looking for the error that shattered my website. I looked online at our study resources, asked for help online and from my teacher, who looked it over and saw the error right away. After helping guide me to the source of the problem through dev tools, and some hints, I realized I was missing a set of quotes around a word, which were necessary to call the variable I was after. I felt silly for missing this small detail in my arrogance, and from this experience i have learned to be more vigilent and detail oriented, as opposed to cocky that I can do no wrong.

              <strong>How have I solved a problem in an elegant way?</strong>
              <p>This one is a little tricky, as most of my solutions so far have a been a little hacky due to my lack of
              experience, however I can think of one example. I was trying to get my redesigned site up and running, when I ran into
              quite a few problems with my CSS. Despite feeling a little blocked, I researched more into responsive design, and how to
              get things positioned with columns and rows, while maintaining mindfulness, which solved my problem. While I feel that 'elegant' can be interperted many ways, I feel like I handled this problem within the traditional definition of the word.</p>
             </li>

             <li> 
              <strong>My reflection on how confident I feel using the following problem solving techniques.</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Pseudocode: This is something i've done very little of, and am not very confident using. </li>
                  <li>Trying Something: I am not fond of this method, as it is very unspecific and if something works, I dont know why.</li>
                  <li>Rubber Ducky: I have tried this with other objects, and it is very helpful, and I am confident using it.</li>
                  <li>Reading the Error: This is very helpful in dev tools, and im happy to use this everytime I get an error</li>
                  <li>Console Logging: This seems more like a blunt tool to me, but is usefull in certain situations.</li>
                  <li>Googling: This is my ultimate problem solving tool, and I feel very comfortable searching google. </li>
                  <li>Asking Peers: Also an excellent source of help, very comfortable asking my peers.</li>
                  <li>Asking Coaches: This is usually my last method as I have almost always solved my issue before needing their guidance.</li>
                  <li>Reflection: I have been trying to employ this method more, as its touted as the best learning tool.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>
            
              <li>
               <strong>How would I define the array functions .map .filter and .reduce in my own words?</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Map allows you to call a function on every element in an array, and place the matching results in a new array.</li>
                  <li>Filter is nearly self explanatory.In its simplist form, you decare a function with certain parameters, and use filter to execute those parameters in your array. </li>
                  <li>Reduce changes values in an array to a single value, by applying a function against values in the array.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
