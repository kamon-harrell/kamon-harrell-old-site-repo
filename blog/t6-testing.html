               <strong>What is scope?</strong>
               <p>Scop in javascript is an interesting thing.  In most programming languages scope keeps most thing inside their respective functions, meaning they can only be used be a very specific chunk of the code. This keeps variables and other defined things from interacting with other, and creating a mess of the program. Javescript does things a little bit different by allowing variables to be interacted with outside of their specific functions. For example, I could have a variable inside of a function, and i could change the value of that variable by redefining its value inside of another function or out side of a function. Javasscript also 'hoists' variables, now im not entirely sure i understand this, but the way i think about it is that it will pick up any global variables, and bring them to the top of the program so they will be executed first, and it will try and apply those values to any and all matching variables that will accept the global value, </p>
