               <strong>What learnings did I take from this chapter?</strong>
               <p> I took away quite a few things from this chapter, some with greater influnce and some with less. 
               I would say that the thing I liked the most was the excerise for the Siberian Northern Rail Road, and the medaphor at the beggining of the chapter regarding the horse. The horse medaphor spoke to me beacause it makes sense, if we allow our emotions (the horse) to run wild without our control, how can we ever expect to master our body and mind?  </p>

             <strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</strong>
             <p>I did not do the two minutes of mindfulness, but instead practiced with the SBRR method. I had an experience recently that I thought would work well for this exercise. It brought forward the emotions I had experienced at the time, and I allowed myself to work through them and the exercise, while trying not to let grasping or aversion take place.</p>
