      My take on the DBC/EDA experience so far, while limited, has been great. I'm loving the communication that my cohort has already developed, and i'm very excited to see what the rest of the course holds for me and those in my cohort. My initial thoughts are that the experience seems daunting, and intimidating, but not insurmountable.<br> While i can't pinpoint my impressions before i started this course, (besides excitment to start something new) they're now in the area of more excitment, more ambition, and the feeling you get when you know you've chosen the right path.<br>When I think about the culture the course has adopted, I feel its aligned with how I see the world. The fact that everyone is treated equally, and expected to show up with an attitude to learn aggressively, seems like a great policy to me. You only get out of this life what you're willing to put in, and EDA seems like a great place for us to invest our time, and efforts.<br> I am very excited to participate in this kind of learning environment, as this style of learning is how I wish the school system in the USA was structured, and does not make me nervous. What does make me nervous is not grasping concepts, but then again I always have my cohort to fall back on.
