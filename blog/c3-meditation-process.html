              <strong>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</strong>
              <p>I had a few opinions on meditation before starting the book, having read into it a little in the past. My thoughts were that it could be helpful with your daily life, and it could help you lead a calmer more stable life. From what ive read so far this seems to be the case that the book makes as well. I was not aware that midfullness was such a component of meditation, but now that i have read a few more details, both practices seem to be very cohesive. </p>

             <strong>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</strong>
             <p> A few things ive picked up from the small amount of reading ive done has been that,happiness is the default emotion, with the caveat that it requires enough training and discipline in mindfulness and meditation to retrain your brain to this state. Another thing I picked up was that there is a proccess you can go through to help train these muscles, and your brain will respond to this training the same way your body will respond to weight training and other excercises.   </p>

              <strong> Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</strong>
              <p> The best technique is the one that works best for you, but more specifically, just sitting with your breathe. Sitting, and just being is a new idea to me, and one that i will enjoy in the future.  </p>
