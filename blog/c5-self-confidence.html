               <strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong>
               <p>They are relatively the same! Being self aware is being conscious of your current state, and being mindfull is the practice
               of bringing ones attention back to a center. Both of these practices are very complimentary, and some could argue are one in the same.   </p>

             <strong>Which practise did I try between the body scan and journaling, and what was my experience of it?</strong>
             <p>I tried the body scan, and found it to be very relaxing, so relaxing in fact that it put me to sleep! 
             Regardless of it putting me to sleep, I tried this again this morning and once again found it profoundly relaxing, and i can see how this would be a good practice to get into for the start of a meditation session. I would also like to try the journaling exercise, as the research behind it is convincing enough to give it a go.  </p>

             <li>
             <strong>What did I take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong>
             <p> I agreed with this section wholeheartedly. Being able to differentiate ourselves from our emotions is 
             very important, otherwise we are creatures that react based on instinct, instead of thoughtful reflection. </p>
