    <strong> Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</strong>
    </p>

    <p> Much like everyone else, i thought the example from the Udacity tutoriul was perfect. Thinking about the DOM, HTML, and CSS as different parts of a house works well in many ways. The HTML is your foundation, which gives you a blue print for how you would want your site to be layed out, IE where you would want your rooms, kitchen etc. When you get the structure completed, you can bring out CSS to decided the texture and paint of the walls, what the flooring is made of, furniture and the like. And finally we get the best part of anything, the part that you use. Javascript is the dimmable lights, your IOT connected thermostat and refrigerator, your amazon echo, and your computer, the interactive things that change a room into more than just 4 walls. </p>

    <p> <strong> What is meant from boxifying design? </strong>
    </p>   

    <p> You have to think of everything you see online, as a box. This is very counterintuitive at first, but when you look in to the code, and your screen, it makes sense. The only way you can orginze things on the screen is if they're squares or rectangles. Often the first step when front end devlopers are building a website, is to box out all visual elements, ti help with the design process.  </p>

    <p> <strong> What is the box model? </strong>
    </p> 
  
  <p> The box model is the set of 4 boxes that can be found in dev tools, which includes a visualization of the margin, border, padding, and the selected container.</p>
