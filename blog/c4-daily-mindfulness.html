               <strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong>
               <p>I found it to be a little..awkward, at first. However once we settled into the conversation and alowed ourselves to be vulnerable and listen to one another it felt very conducive and relaxing. My partner, who i had the conversation with, said she felt the same way.</p>

             <strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong>
             <p> Walking mindufulness, looping conversation, and dipping all seem like viable practices to continue on with.  </p>
