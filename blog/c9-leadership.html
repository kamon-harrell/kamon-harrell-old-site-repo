              <strong>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</strong>
              <p>I have been fortunate to not have any bosses or leaders who have been of the mind that using force or being a jerk is the only way to do things, and have been lucky enought to have compassionate bosses. I can personally attest to the fact that having a compassionate boss will definitley make for happier and more productive workers/coworkers</p>

              <strong>Do the multiplying goodness exercise, how did i find it?</strong>
              <p>Very relaxing!</p>
            </li>

              <strong>Do the tonglen meditation, how did i find it?</strong>
              <p>Once again another profound meditation exercise, i found this one to be a variation of an exercise i had learned a few years back, which i have been doing for a while now</p>

              <strong>How does the SCARF model apply to your phase 0 experience? How will it apply to bootcamp?</strong>
              <p>I believe all of the things in this model apply to our experience during phase 0, but in a positive way. While we may struggle with some of the specifics of this model, learning about it more in depth and being able to indentify with a portion of it , can help us better understand our selves and others, which im sure will be a valuable skill during our bootcamp experience</p>

              <strong>Have a difficult conversation, how did it go?</strong>
              <p>It was...difficult. Although it was, i found this conversation to bring some things to light which needed to be addressed between myself and the other person. During this conversation i did my best to maintain a level of mindfullness, and to allow the other person to speak without me interupting them. this acheived very favourable results, which without some guidence from the book, im not sure would have been acheived.</p>
