               <strong>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? how did it go?</strong>
               <p>I so far have not used any of these techniques yet, but i would like to employ them in the future as i continue to build new relationships with people </p>

                  <strong>Try empathic listening, how did it go?</strong>
                  <p>I have tried this technique with my partner, and it went suprisingly well, being that i tend to be psychologizing when we speak. She really appreciated me being quiet for once and letting her speak, and using language that was understanding and empathic.</p>

              <strong>Political awareness exercise </strong>
              <p>This seems like it will be difficult exercise, but here it goes.
              A friend and i were on the discussion of guns, and gun control in America, being that its a constant topic of discussion in our media, due to unfortunante events that happen every day in America. Now, having been around firearms since i was a child, and being taught by my grandfather(who is a gunsmith) and my father how to handle, operate, clean and store firearms responsibly, im fairly pro gun. My friend, who had never been around firearms, was trying to convince me that we should eliminate all firearms from our country, they do no good, and only the government and military should be allowed to have them due to the recent increase in gun violence. This position confused me, as i had grown up with guns being a part of my familys heritage, and after my grandfather retired from the marines, he made his living and supported his family through gun smithing and repair. I can remember being a child, and being fasinated by my grandfathers shop, which he runs out of his garage to this day. When i turned 8, my grandfather gave me the .22 caliber rifle that he had been given to him by his father as a child, way back in the 1950's. I rememebr going shooting with my dad and my grandpa all the time, but always with the caveat that firearms were powerful weapons, and not toys. They were tools that were to be treated with the utmost respect, or there would be serious consequences, for myself or someone else. As i child i could never imagine using a firearm for any purpose other than target practice, and i was not allowed to even have my guns in my house until i turned 18, they stayed locked in my grandfathers safe until we went to the range. I explained to my friend that there will always be evil in the world, and people will always be willing to do terrible things, with, or with out guns, and that it dosent make anysense to me to strip responsible gun owners of their rights to own and use firearms responsibly. However, when i look at it from my friends perspective, and remove my personal experince from it, it could make sense. If i had grown up in a household where i was never exposed to firearms, and only the the damage that had come from them was displayed to me, i can see how some one would form this opinion. Now, my friend may have had a negative experince with firearms that im not aware of and this may be the reason for his opinion, but the point of this exercise is to assume the opposing view is 100 percent correct and reasonable. </p>
