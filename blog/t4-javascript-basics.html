               <strong>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong>
               <p>I suppose Javascript is to HTML/CSS like baking is to cooking. They both require ingredients, tools, and an oven, but baking is much more specific and scientific, where cooking is much more fast and loose, javscript would be the baking. </p>

             <strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</strong>
             <p>Control flow is the order in which things are excecuted and interpeted.Once again we can look back to the baking analogy. In baking there is a recipe, and often times, if you do not follow that recipe exactly, whatever youre baking will not turn out how you expect. The same applys for coding, and loops. If things are not in their correct place, and executed in the correct order, the code will not run.</p>
             </li>

             <li> 
              <strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</strong>
              <p>Accessing data from an array would be to specify with a number, as this is how things are stored in an array, while accessing object literals can be done through text, or 'strings'. </p>
             </li>
            
              <li>
               <strong>What are functions and why are they useful?</strong>
              <p> A function is a collection of actions or information, designed to be executed in a specific order, whenever the function is called. This is useful because instead of having to type out all of the code you want multiple times, you can simpy call the function over and over again, consitently acheiving the same result. </p>
