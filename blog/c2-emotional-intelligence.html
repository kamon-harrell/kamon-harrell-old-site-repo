    <h2> How I feel about the SIY material, and what I learned</h2>
      <p>
       
       What I have gleaned from both the video, and the 1st chapter of the SIY material was both impactful, and insightful. I had no idea that simply listening to your body, (gut feeling) was actually based in science, and that your body was starting to send signals before your brain could register them. What I've learned is that i need to slow down, practice my mindfulness, and listen to my intuition. What ive also learned is that these are things that you dont just conjure, they are skills that need to be honed, and practiced in order to be used in the most effective form. The two minutes of mindfulness felt very satisfying, and helped me regain focus on the current assignment!
