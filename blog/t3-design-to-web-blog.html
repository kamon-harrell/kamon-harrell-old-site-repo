               <strong>What is a responsive site, and why is responsiveness important?</strong>
               <p> A responsive site it one that changes the content based on the size of the screen, or device you are using. This could mean eliminating elements found on a larger page, or stacking content to look nice on a smaller screen.</p>
             </li>

             <li>
             <strong>What is mobile first design, and why is it important?</strong>
             <p> Mobile first is a design method used when creating responsive web sites and content. If you start a design using a limited screen size such as a mobile device, then you are forced to focus on whats most important, and how to make an easy to use interface. This translates perfectly for making the desktop sites, as you can focus on adding new content, as opposed to stripping it away.</p>

              <strong>What are frameworks, and what are their pros and cons?</strong>
              <p> Frameworks are almost like blueprints you can use and edit to make creating websites and other programs a bit easier, and much faster. Instead of reinventing the wheel, you can simply buy a premade wheel, and make adjustments accordingly.</p>

               <strong>What is a wireframe and why do we use them?</strong>
              <p> A wireframe is the start of a design, where we sketch out how we want the site to be layed out, where content, images, and nav bars go. This is the first brick in the building. Some of my first wireframes are below!</p>

               <strong>What aspects of my wireframe did i find hard to implement?</strong>
              <p> The hardest part of using wireframes, was getting everything to match up with what I drew on paper! Trying to get my nav bar to move around was very difficult for some reason, and getting the footer to stay on the bottom of the page as well</p>              </li>
