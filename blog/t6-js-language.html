               <strong>How to use parentheses</strong>
               <p>Parentheses can be used in a few ways </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Give parameters to a function(a,b)</li>
                  <li>Prioritize order of operations (3 + 3) -3 </li>
                  <li>These can also group together strings and function (('How') + ((2 + 2 = 4) + (4 = 'are you'))) </li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <strong> [] How to use them, and what they are.</strong>
             <p>These are brackets, and they are mostly associated with arrays. Arrays are bunches of information, and brackets allow you to create arrays, access their data, and manipulate the data inside of the array. Brackets can also be used to access and manipulate data inside of an object.</p>
             </li>

             <li> 
              <strong> {}, the things no one wants on their teeth</strong>
              <p>Braces are how we store information into blocks of code. By storing code this way, we can easily read it, dictate which function its assigned to, and store lots of information. Braces may also be used to define object parameters, which can be accessed and manipulated with brackets! example  
              ObjectX = {property1: value 1, property2: value 2} 
              normally this would look different (it would all be stacked) when used in actual code, but im to lazy to format it correctly

               <strong>Quotes with out a partner, and swinger quotes</strong>
              <p> '' single quotes in javascript can be both used for single characters, and strings. Mainly used as a way for developers to be lazy and not hit the shift key for double quotes, but can also help with reducing the total number of characters, and there for less memory in the file(although im sure this is a negligible amount of memory)
              "" double quotes are nearly identical to single quotes, except you cant use them both in thhe same string, and double quotes help to keep you computer from getting confused. See if you were to pass a string to your computer like
              'I like Sally's shells' it would get confused and end the string at Sally, instead of reading to the end of shells.
              This is because it sees the single quote, and wants to end the string there. Now you can get around this by using a \ before the first single quote like this 'I like Sally\'s shells' and tell it ignore that quote, or you could just use double quotes and avoid the hassle, like this "I like Sally's shells"
