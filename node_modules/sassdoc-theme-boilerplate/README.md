# Imarc SassDoc Theme

This is very slightly modified version of SassDoc's default theme, as that seemed to be the most functional starting point for building a new theme; I had trouble with sassdoc-theme-blank.

The main additions were adding in `@emmet` and `@demo` annotations, as well as setting up a place where we'll be able to edit the templates and styling for documentation.
