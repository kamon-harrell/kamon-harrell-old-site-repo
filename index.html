                                <h4 class="segment_content">I've been doing web development professionally for about 2 years now, and want to show you a few of the projects I've worked on, and the technologies I like to work with. But first, a little bit about me! I was born and raised in the Seattle Washington area, and stayed there until I was 21 when I went to New Zealand for school(more about that later!) Before I was a developer, I worked in the construction industry, doing commercial and residential fibreglass repair work. Technology has always been a huge passion for me, and I was tired of doing something I hated, when I could be doing something I love. I began studying web development in my free time, while saving to attend a boot-camp. An opportunity arose when I discovered Enspiral Dev Academy in New Zealand. I have family that live in the country, and the tuition was nearly half that of what similar programs cost here in the states. So I packed my things, and moved across the planet for 9 months! After my graduation I worked for a small start up while waiting to return to the states, and have since relocated from Seattle to Denver, where I'm starting my career and life with my partner of 5 years. I love working in a Javascript environment, and in my spare time, i like to make games with Unity and C# </h4>

                                <dd> <h4 class="segment_content"> WheyCartel is a SPA( single page application) premium whey protein subscription service, which was built with React, Bootstrap, Python, BrainTree, Node, Firebase, and more. I worked with WheyCartel as a Front End Development intern for about 3 months, shortly after graduating from Enspiral Dev Academy. I couldn't say better things about my experience working with Nelson and Rab, the founders of the site. They gave me an opportunity to jump into the team right away, and continue to learn and grow in a professional environment. <br> <br>
                                  Despite me being an intern, Nelson, our head of development, put me in charge of quite a bit right away. This was a great chance for me to stretch my skills, knowing that help was right around the corner if need be. A few of the things I accomplished for the WheyCartel team were, </h4>
                                  <ul>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>I was put in charge of creating a complete user dashboard from Photoshop documents, where users could view their current subscription and billing information, and make changes to their account.</li>
                                    <li>We used modern web technologies to build our application, so we needed to do browser testing to get a better picture of what our users could look forward to. I tested the site across all modern browsers(Chrome, Firefox) and a litany of different devices, screen sizes, and mobile browsers. It even works on IE9!</li>
                                    <li>We used Git as source control when I was in school, and we also used it for the development  of the WheyCartel platform. This made it easy for me to submit my features and code for peer review, which lead to almost eliminated creating new bugs in the production environment.</li>
                                    <li>As part of following the agile process, we were constantly updating, and using a prioritised backlog. This was great for the team, since our lead dev and myself could create new tickets when we came across bugs or other tasks, and the whole team could see what was being worked on, and what was already finished.</li>
                                    <li>When it came to data storage, particularly in the case of the user dashboard, we needed easily accessible and fast storage. Firebase fit all of our needs with its easy to use API, and connection to the rest of the google suite. </li>

This project was the culminating effort of my time at Enspiral Dev Academy, and was worked on by my entire graduating class. We had a pitch day to decide on which ideas we all liked the most, and this was my idea. Since it was my idea, I helped guide our team through what my vision was for the project, and the design, architecture, styling. Our team of 8 people spent 7 days on this project, including all of the planning and execution. Most of those days were 12 hours plus of planning, coding, stand-ups, prioritising, testing, and practising for the live graduation demo we had to do in front of friends, family, and potential employers. <br> <br>

                                      <li>As i mentioned above, I pitched the idea to my team, and was responsible for convincing them this was the best idea to spend our time on</li>
                                      <li>Having a natural tenancy to lead, I was elected by my classmates to be our scrum master/product owner for the duration of the build out. This helped my gain experience not only in communicating effectively with my team in a high stress environment, but also making sure that any conflict within the team was appropriately resolved. </li>
                                      <li>I wasn't just a team leader on this project, I also helped code the landing page, authentication, user profiles, database management, UI/UX, and much more using technologies like React, Redux, Node, Express, JSON web tokens,  and postgreSQL. </li>
                                      <li>Since I was elected to be the scrum master, I was also in charge of our backlog and running our stand-ups. Being able to assign tasks to people with Trello was a huge factor in our ability to communicate effectively, and to conduct code reviews.</li>
